# Airport in Jest

This is a repeat of the Airport exercise originally written in Ruby [here](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/airport_challenge). The purpose of this exercise was to learn the test framework Jest and how to do the following:
- write tests with matchers
- mock entire modules
- stub methods & randomness
- perform dependancy injection 

This exercise was entirely self-driven and I had to use the Jest documentaiton and Google/Stack Overflow to troubleshoot problems.

My aim is to learn Jest ahead of learning to use React so that I am already familiar with the test framework. Previous exercises in JS relied on the browser version of Jasmine.

## How to use
